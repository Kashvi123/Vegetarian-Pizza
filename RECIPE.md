Instructions:- 
    1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.

    2. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the two pizzas, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges. Evenly distribute the spinach on top of the sauce, followed by the cheese (use all three cups if you want a cheesy pizza as shown here).

    3. Top the pizzas with artichoke, bell pepper, red onion, tomatoes, olives and almonds (if using).

    4. Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).

    5. Transfer pizzas to a cutting board and sprinkle with with fresh basil, red pepper flakes and Parmesan, if using. Slice and serve! 
        
            *Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator for 4 days, or for several months in the freezer.

    Notes:-  
        MAKE IT NUT FREE: Omit the almonds.

        CHANGE IT UP: On top of the mozzarella, use any combination of the suggested toppings (up to 3 cups t0tal). The spinach and almonds are not essential.
